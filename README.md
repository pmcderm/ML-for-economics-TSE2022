We replicate methods and perform some extensions.

Short Summary: We look at student level determinants of math test scores, assuming a school level fixed (or random) effect. We extract the fixed effect, which can be thought of as a measure of school value-add, then use school level data to estimate top determinants of school value add. Replication is REEM tree and boosted regression tree methodology. Extension is linear fixed effect and random forest methodology.
